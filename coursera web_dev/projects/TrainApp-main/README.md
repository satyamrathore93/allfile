Additional information
In addition to the above, you may want to include the following information in your README.md file:

A description of your app, including what it does and how to use it.
Screenshots or videos of your app in action.
A link to your app's GitHub repository or other code hosting site.
A list of known issues and bugs.
Contribution guidelines.
You should also update your README.md file whenever you make significant changes to your app, such as adding new features or fixing bugs.

Notes on your package.json file
I noticed that you are using a few different navigation libraries in your package.json file. It is generally best to choose one navigation library and stick to it. This will help to make your code more consistent and easier to maintain.

I also noticed that you are using the realm database library. Realm is a great choice for mobile databases, but it is important to note that it is not a free library. You will need to purchase a license if you plan to use it in production.

Conclusion
I hope this is helpful! Please let me know if you have any other questions.
